This game allows players to choose their course load and deterine how they can have a good semester.
If/Elif/Else statements wre used in Step 2. Membership and logical operators were used in Step 3. Identity operators and nested if-statements were used in Step 4.
First, players are asked to input their stats. Then they're asked to choose their course load, depending on their GPA. Next, they are allowed to choose what they will study. 
Depending on this, their stress level will increase, decrease, or stay the same. Next, they have the otion to take a break(as long as they want) or not. This will affect their stress level.
Lastly depending on their final stats, they will have been told if they had a good, decent, or bad semester.
